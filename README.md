## Convert Galaxy workflow files to (abstract) CWL

- Initially the output will be an abstract version of a CWL workflow (aka cwl-interface, see https://github.com/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language/issues/337). As the CWL support in Galaxy increases then conversion could come up with a full CWL workflow file.
